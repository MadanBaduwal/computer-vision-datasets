[CAVIAR](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CAVIARDATA1/)
- For the CAVIAR project a number of video clips were recorded acting out the different scenarios of interest. These include people walking alone, meeting with others, window shopping, entering and exitting shops, fighting and passing out and last, but not least, leaving a package in a public place.

[ViSOR](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/visor/)
- ViSOR contains a large set of multimedia data and the corresponding annotations.

[CUHK Crowd Dataset](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/~jshao/CUHKcrowd_files/cuhk_crowd_dataset.htm)
- 474 video clips from 215 crowded scenes, with ground truth on group detection and video classes.?

[TImes Square Intersection (TISI) Dataset](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_qmul_TISI_dataset.html)
- A busy outdoor dataset for research on visual surveillance.

[Educational Resource Centre (ERCe) Dataset](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_qmul_ERCe_dataset.html)
- An indoor dataset collected from a university campus for physical event understanding of long video streams.

[PIROPO Database: People in Indoor ROoms with Perspective and Omnidirectional cameras](https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/research/gti-data/databases)
- Multiple sequences recorded in two different indoor rooms, using both omnidirectional and perspective cameras, containing people in a variety of situations (people walking, standing, and sitting). Both annotated and non-annotated sequences are provided, where ground truth is point-based. In total, more than 100,000 annotated frames are available.

[UNICITY: A depth maps database for people detection in security airlocks](https://zenodo.org/record/2556679#.Ytw-INJBx9C)
- UNICITY consists of 58k images collected from 65 recorded sequences with one or two people performing different behaviors including attacks and trickeries. It also provides full annotation of people such as the location of head and shoulders.
