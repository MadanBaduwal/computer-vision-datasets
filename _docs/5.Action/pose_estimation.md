### Pose estimation / Human pose / Expression 
* Pose Estimation is a computer vision technique to predict and track the location of a person or object.
* This is typically done by identifying, locating, and tracking a number of keypoints on a given object or person. 

[Leeds Sport Poses](https://docs.activeloop.ai/datasets/lsp-dataset#:~:text=What%20is%20LSP%20Dataset%3F,%22%2C%20and%20%22athletics%22.)
- The LSP dataset contains 10,000 images gathered from Flickr searches for the tags "parkour", "gymnastics", and "athletics".

[AFEW (Acted Facial Expressions In The Wild)/SFEW (Static Facial Expressions In The Wild)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/few/)
- Dynamic temporal facial expressions data corpus consisting of close to real world environment extracted from movies.

[Expression in-the-Wild (ExpW) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/socialrelation/index.html)
- Contains 91,793 faces manually labeled with expressions. Each of the face images was manually annotated as one of the seven basic expression categories: â€œangryâ€, â€œdisgustâ€, â€œfearâ€, â€œhappyâ€, â€œsadâ€, â€œsurpriseâ€, or â€œneutralâ€.

[ETHZ CALVIN Dataset](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~calvin/datasets.html)
- CALVIN research group datasets

[HandNet (annotated depth images of articulating hands)](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~twerd/HandNet/)
- This dataset includes 214971 annotated depth images of hands captured by a RealSense RGBD sensor of hand poses. Annotations: per pixel classes, 6D fingertip pose, heatmap. Images -> Train: 202198, Test: 10000, Validation: 2773. Recorded at GIP Lab, Technion.

[3D Human Pose Estimation](http://albert.cm/projects/viewpoint_3d_pose/)
- Depth videos + ground truth human poses from 2 viewpoints to improve 3D human pose estimation.

[Dynamic Faust](https://dfaust.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- More than 40.000 scans of people very accurately registered. Scans contain texture so synthetic videos/images are easy to generate. See also Dyna: A Model of Dynamic Human Shape in Motio.

[BUFF dataset](https://buff.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- About 10.000 scans of people in clothing and the estimated body shape of people underneath. Scans contain texture so synthetic videos/images are easy to generate.

[TNT 15 dataset](https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/project/TNT15/)
- Several sequences of video synchronised by 10 Inertial Sensors (IMU) worn at the extremities.

[Extended Chictopia dataset](https://files.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/classner/gp/)
- Chictopia dataset with additional processed annotations (face) and SMPL body model fits to the images. The copyright of the images belongs to the original authors of Chictopia.


[Professional Portrait Dataset](https://sites.psu.edu/farshidfarhat/2017/07/02/intelligent-portrait-composition-assistance-integrating-deep-learned-models-and-photography-idea-retrieval/)
- Over 320,000 highly-rated portrait images crawled from 500px website.
