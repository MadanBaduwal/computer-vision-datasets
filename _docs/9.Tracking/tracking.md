## video tracking/ object tracking

[BIWI Walking Pedestrians dataset](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets/)
- Walking pedestrians in busy scenarios from a bird eye view

["Central" Pedestrian Crossing Sequences](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets/)
- Three pedestrian crossing sequences

[Pedestrian Mobile Scene Analysis](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets/)
- The set was recorded in Zurich, using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. It contains 12'298 annotated pedestrians in roughly 2'000 frames.


[Head tracking](http://www.clemson.edu/cecas/)
- BMP image sequences.

[KIT AIS Dataset](https://www.ipf.kit.edu/downloads.php)
- Data sets for tracking vehicles and people in aerial image sequences.

[MIT Traffic Data Set](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/MITtraffic.html)
- MIT traffic data set is for research on activity analysis and crowded scenes. It includes a traffic video sequence of 90 minutes long. It is recorded by a stationary camera.

[Shinpuhkan 2014 dataset: Multi-Camera Pedestrian Dataset for Tracking People across Multiple Cameras](http://www.mm.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/datasets/shinpuhkan)
- This dataset consists of more than 22,000 images of 24 people which are captured by 16 cameras installed in a shopping mall "Shinpuh-kan". All images are manually cropped and resized to 48x128 pixels, grouped into tracklets and added annotation.

[ATC shopping center dataaset](https://dil.atr.jp/crest2010_HRI/ATC_dataset/)
- The tracking environment consists of multiple 3D range sensors, covering an area of about 900 m2, in the "ATC" shopping center in Osaka, Japan.

[Human detection and tracking using RGB-D camera](http://www.cv.fudan.edu.cn/humandetection.htm)
- Collected in a clothing store. Captured with Kinect (640*480, about 30fps)

[Multiple Camera Tracking](http://www.santhoshsunderrajan.com/datasets.html#hfh_tracking)
- Hallway Corridor - Multiple Camera Tracking: An indoor camera network dataset with 6 cameras (contains ground plane homography).

[Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark](https://motchallenge.net/)
- A centralized benchmark for multi-object tracking.

[Stanford Drone Dataset](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/uav_data/)
- The dataset consists of eight unique scenes in crowded spaces such as a university campus or the sidewalks of a busy street.

[Moving cameras monitoring the same scenes](https://web.stanford.edu/~alahi/FixMobdata.htm)
- Low-resolution RGB videos + ground truth trajectories from multiple fixed and moving cameras monitoring the same scenes (indoor and outdoor) to improve object tracking and matching.
