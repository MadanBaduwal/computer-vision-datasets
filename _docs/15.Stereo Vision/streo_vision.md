## Stereo Vision
* Is the process of extracting 3D information from digital images taken by two cameras displaced horizontally from one another to obtain two different views of the same scene.
* Stereo Vision refers to getting the 3D coordinates of a point in a 2D image by using two or more images taken from different points of view. Triangulation or feature matching can be done to determine the 3D point.
